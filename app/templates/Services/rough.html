<ul>
    <li>
      <b>Microservices Architecture –</b> We design backend systems as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services to improve scalability, fault isolation, and team agility.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Domain-Driven Design (DDD) –</b> We organize backend codebases around the business domain, improving clarity, maintainability, and alignment between engineering and business teams.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Clean Architecture –</b> Our code is structured with clear separation of concerns (use cases, interfaces, infrastructure) to ensure long-term maintainability and testability.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>API-First Development –</b> We define and document APIs before implementation using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI to streamline frontend-backend collaboration and ensure robust, scalable interfaces.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Asynchronous & Event-Driven Programming –</b> We leverage message queues (like RabbitMQ, Kafka) and async frameworks to build highly responsive, non-blocking applications.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Test-Driven Development (TDD) –</b> We write automated tests before code to ensure high reliability, catch bugs early, and support continuous integration.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Security-First Engineering –</b> Our backend code follows OWASP best practices for authentication, data encryption, input validation, and threat mitigation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>CI/CD & DevOps Integration –</b> We incorporate continuous integration, delivery, and deployment pipelines to enable fast, automated, and safe updates to production.
    </li>
